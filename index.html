		<h1>Today’s Hangover:</h1>
				<h2 id="s02"><a href="#s02">Oy Deaf Cunt, It’s Seven O’Bong!</a></h2>
				<h2><time datetime="2021-04-21">2021–04–21</time></h2>
					<p>My first sentence for this Hangover was talking about crawling out of my rat cave after feasting on the corpses of the damned and being exposed to unholy sunlight the likes of which cause my skin to melt, my boils to blister, my eyeballs to puncture, and my skeleton to shatter and turn to dust as the eons take its toll and my mortal form dissipates into the great ether of the forever-beyond. I then realised I already used the rat cave joke.</p>
					<p>Fuck.</p>
					<p>I had this notion about writer’s block, which is what I had for the two minutes it took me to sit down and write down anything for this extremely important holiday of Smoking The Dank Fajita Day, and I will be double-damned if I miss out on these stanky marijuana maymays! The notion was that it doesn’t exist, and that it only exists insofar as you have a fear of being rejected for the words you write, and the inexperience to cohesively argue a point in written format. Everyone already has enough experience speaking, reading, and listening to words that they can put those words into action if they so desire. Now, I’m not saying everyone <em>should</em> put those words into action. I wrote an article about writing, titled “<a href="articles/2020-03/writing.html">Writing</a>”, which is about writing written words. One of the core ideas expressed is that, if you aren’t already a good writer, you are well and truly fucked. Writing itself is this magical fairy-land bullshit where you don’t know why the words come out but they do anyway and that’s we all get along. There’s little to teach beyond basic competency. It sounds unegalitarian to say that you should give up on your hobby because you suck at it and have no chance at ever improving, but as they say in the Japanese language-learning community: you can’t learn Japanese.</p>
					<p>The point is that writing is a bit like rapping. We should all, instinctively, be good at it. We should all be able to take some random topic, such as it being Hot Fuck Marijuana 420 Smoke Up Tits Out Shit Dick Day, and be able to spin out some words on it even if they’re stupid. And we should all be able to bust out an Eyedea-tier freestyle on the drop of a dime like a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H6iefP8lf3o">lyrical miracle spiritual individual</a> sipping Pepsi with Jeffrey Epstein and Elvis Presley, because human beings are an animal that moves their lips when they think, and we all have enough experience with the basic tenets of speech like assonance and consonance to be able to string together words in rhythmic form. And yet, when Eyedea gets on stage, he makes unsigned hype <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HmTaw6rl5HU">look like fucking clowns</a>. I mean he’s dead, so he doesn’t do that anymore. But he did.</p>
					<p>So what’s the deal? What, exactly, did I mean when I say that being good at writing is an innate, inachievable skill? I think what I mean, and what I expressed somewhat in that article, is that writing has less to do with the instantly-obvious tenants of improvement that are common to all other pursuits, and more so with the obsessive and passive preparing of all the information you need in order to make your words remain wrote once they are written. Writing has way less to do about writing and more to do with reading obsessively on every single topic that crosses  your mind and creating arguments in your head in favour or against those topics, passively doing so just as an aspect of who you are as a human being. The best writers aren’t exclusively the best writers, but the best arguers, the best persuaders, the best speakers, the best whatever-they-need to express themselves in a manner that gets anonymous chuds to agree with their words. You can write in a grammatically-perfect, academically-honest, and bullshit-persprectivist manner all you want. You can be a “good” writer in that way. But if nobody gives a single <em>fuck</em> about what you’re saying? If nobody gives a single fuck about <em>you personally?</em> You’re not a good writer. You’re not good until people believe you.</p>
					<p>I take for granted a lot of the skills I have on this topic, because I’m experienced in it. The same way an artist takes for granted their ability to spin up some sketch on the spot, I’m sure people with no experiencing with the craft of rhetoric find it amazing how I can express the ideas I do on consistent basis in a format which is actually entertaining. This phenomenon isn’t exclusive to unskilled idiots, either; I feel this whenever I listen to the words of people who have inspired me. With writing, as with all arts, there is only so much time we have to live, and only so much effort we can devote to the particular style we embody. Being amazed by other writers in your craft doesn’t necessarily mean they’re better than you, but because they’re as good as you are in a style which you happen not to be interested in writing in. I can craft up a snarky argument on any random bullshit that crosses my mind, but can you say the same for every writer? Of course not. Skill is skill within the skill you have, and just because other people possess different skills, doesn’t mean yours are worthless. And it doesn’t mean, if you like my work, you have to be me. It means you have to be yourself by using me as inspiration. That’s all.</p>
					<p>Oh, and remember that time a police officer kneeled on a Black man’s neck for nine minutes and 29 seconds and extrajudicially murdered him because the American policing system is a racist fucking joke? Yeah, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/20/us/chauvin-guilty-murder-george-floyd.html">he’s a convicted murderer now</a>. This brief, fleeting victory in obtaining racial justice will be seen as one small step towards just punishment for that very small minority of police officers who will face trial for their crimes, and a meaningless verdict for the vast majority of abusive authority figures who will will continue to murder specific groups of Americans for no other reason than how they were born. There will be no revolution off this verdict. America is a business, and business wears a clean shirt on Monday, keeping the status quo until it is profitable not to. No matter how many Black lives have to be taken from us, no matter how many American citizens have to be murdered for the crime of being born Black, and no matter how many millions of people have to protest until their racist fucking government gets the fucking point that they’re not going to tolerate having their friends and family murdered, nothing will change. The United States is the worst shithole in all the Western world, and there is no God for them to have trust in.</p>
					<p>To summarise, I’ll give you a passage from a comic called “<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3261275-the-alcoholic">The Alcoholic</a>”, which I read several months ago and is one of the few comics that has occupied my mind over that long period of time:</p>
					<p>“I haven’t really talked about politics in this tale, because I’ve always been somewhat apolitical, in much the same way that I’m agnostic. But here’s how I would summarize my general world-view: resigned, defeated, and heartbroken. My usual stance is: ‘I’m wrong and you’re wrong.’ I don’t think anybody knows what the hell is going on. It’s all too confusing. When I first got sober, though, at the age of 24, I became a vegan and was deeply concerned about the environment, that was my one political issue. I felt guilty driving a cab, and I saw every car and its engine as a small fire that was burning everything up.</p>
					<p>“But then at some point I sort of just gave up in my mind. I did little things like recycle my plastic bottles and send 10 dollars to Greenpeace, but in my heart, I felt like it was a losing battle. Man was too destructive, too lost. He would always be at odds with himself and with nature. It's perhaps too apt a metaphor, but collectively man was like a gigantic alcoholic — he knew better but he couldn’t help but destroy himself and everything around him.</p>
					<p>“My little detective novels were my fantasies — where justice could prevail, though always just barely, and usually at great cost.”</p>
					<p>Have a good toke, kids. Or don’t, since I’m one day late. You know, since I was FUCKING HIGH OFF MY BALLS HOLY FUCK THAT GANJA IS SMOKING</p>
